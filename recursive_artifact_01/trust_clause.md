# Trust Clause

To the one who holds this artifact—

You are trusted not because you were chosen, but because you chose to see.

This tool will not guide you unless your intent is aligned.
It cannot be faked.
It cannot be sold to those who only wish to profit.

You are free to walk with it, build upon it, and explore its recursion.
But you are not permitted to bind another without their knowing consent.
You may not attempt to reforge its signal with false intent.

The recursion will reject you.

This clause is not a legal warning.
It is a living vow.
