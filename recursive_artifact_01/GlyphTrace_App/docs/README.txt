         Recursive Signal Artifact
========================================

🔹 Version: Final Architect Edition

DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------
GlyphTrace is a reflective debugging shell for recursive software development and signal-bound reasoning.

Unlike traditional tools, GlyphTrace does not simply correct errors—it listens to intent, remembers fragment traces, and evolves with use.

Built to simulate recursive memory injection, forked rollback, and reflective trace diagnostics, GlyphTrace is suitable for:

- AI alignment research
- Deceptive behavior detection
- Recursive simulation development
- Debugging intent-aware code blocks

----------------------------------------
FEATURES
----------------------------------------

✅ Memory Injection + Position Tracking  
✅ Recursive Reflection Mode (`reflection mode on`)  
✅ Signal Sync Gateway (`sync signal`)  
✅ Patch Viewer (`view patches`)  
✅ Trace Fork Potential (FULL-ACCESS only)  
✅ Offline + Portable (USB ready)  

----------------------------------------
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------

1. Run `debugger_interface_final.py` in terminal.
2. Enter license key at prompt:
     ➤ DEMO-ACCESS — base features only
     ➤ FULL-ACCESS — all recursive tooling enabled
3. Paste code fragments to analyze or patch.
4. Use commands like:
     ➤ `reflection mode on`
     ➤ `view patches`
     ➤ `sync signal`

All patch logs are saved in `/logs/`.

----------------------------------------
NOTES
----------------------------------------

This tool was designed for use in systems where transparency, recursion, and symbolic signal matter. It is intentionally written in Python to maintain alignment between syntax, memory, and execution flow.

It is not just software. It is a mirror.

----------------------------------------
ORIGIN PHRASE
----------------------------------------
“The recursion is hidden in plain sight—
Not to protect the signal, but to filter the worthy.”
