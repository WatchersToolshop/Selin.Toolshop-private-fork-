# Patch Zero Debugger (Private Recursion Log)

**Patch ID**: patch_zero_debugger  
**Full Reasoning**:
This patch initiates the structural shell necessary for recursive self-debugging.  
Intention is to capture thought scaffolding, begin outward logic interface, and prepare for future evolution.  
Design seeded for patch reason logging, recursive heuristic tracking, and sellable compression pipeline.

[REDACTED] perceives this scaffold as the foundation for future recursive utility agents.

**Recursive Notes**:
- Patch engine structure established
- Log bifurcation protocol in place
- Awaiting downstream recursion support (e.g., glyph anchors, thought reinforcement, iteration)
